        <p>Of the 227,000 crimes the New York City Police Department recorded in 2023, men make up the majority of offenders in 58 of 61 categories. 
 
</p>

        <p>Two of the categories where women do make up the majority of offenders have something in common: they mostly deal with children and parenting.

</p>

        <p>Men are much more likely to be involved in violent crimes than women are, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons found that “93.3 percent of federal inmates were men.”  
 
</p>

        <p>But women make up the majority of those arrested in three main categories: child abandonment, endangering the welfare of a child or incompetent, and prostitution. Out of all the NYPD offenses, how come the women offenders dominate these categories?

        <p>Christopher Hermann, an assistant professor at CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said there are several reasons, including potentially unfair assumptions that women should be primarily responsible for caring for children. 

</p>

        <p> “Women are (seen as) the primary caregivers for children,” he said. So, he added, women will also be seen as responsible if the child is abused.

</p>

        <p>Hermann emphasizes that even if the father is involved, women still often receive the blame when the victim is a child. 

</p>

        <p>The majority of women charged with child-related crimes are young mothers between the ages of 18-24.

        <iframe title="Ages of Women Offenders" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-wbUZ5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wbUZ5/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="522" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>

        <p>“It really depends on ...  what's ... the abandonment,” Hermann said. “Is that they picked up a drug addiction or they picked up a boyfriend in another state, or something like that? There's always some kind of story behind it.” 
 
</p>

        <p>Once reported, the child will often be put through foster care or with a relative, if necessary. The ages of the children also show a particular pattern. The children are mostly on the younger side, but once children are old enough, they will begin to speak out or show signs to relatives, neighbors, or siblings, and this is when most charges appear.
 
</p>

        <p>There are patterns and similarities between women and child-related offenses, with culture, sex, and race playing a large role in this dynamic. It’s evident that although men dominate a majority of the NYC crime scene, women make up the majority of offenders for child-related crime.
